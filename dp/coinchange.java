/*1. You are given a number n, representing the count of coins.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the denominations of n coins.
3. You are given a number "amt".
4. You are required to calculate and print the number of combinations of the n coins using which the 
     amount "amt" can be paid.

Note1 -> You have an infinite supply of each coin denomination i.e. same coin denomination can be 
                  used for many installments in payment of "amt"
Note2 -> You are required to find the count of combinations and not permutations i.e.
                  2 + 2 + 3 = 7 and 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 and 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 are different permutations of same 
                  combination. You should treat them as 1 and not 3.
