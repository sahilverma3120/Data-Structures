There are n rooms you need to visit, labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each day is labeled, starting from 0. You will go in and visit one room a day.

Initially on day 0, you visit room 0. The order you visit the rooms for the coming days is determined by the following rules and a given 0-indexed array nextVisit of length n:

Assuming that on a day, you visit room i,
if you have been in room i an odd number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit the room specified by nextVisit[i] where 0 <= nextVisit[i] <= i;
if you have been in room i an even number of times (including the current visit), on the next day you will visit room (i + 1) mod n.
Return the label of the first day where you have been in all the rooms. It can be shown that such a day exists. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
