//952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor
/*
You are given an integer array of unique positive integers nums. Consider the following graph:

There are nums.length nodes, labeled nums[0] to nums[nums.length - 1],
There is an undirected edge between nums[i] and nums[j] if nums[i] and nums[j] share a common factor greater than 1.
Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.
